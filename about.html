        <img id="aboutpic" alt="Origin Story" src="./assets/images/about.jpg">
        <p>We started off in Buffalo NY. Good ol' Johnny Smith started the resturant because he wanted to 
            make the worst resturaunt imaginable which only had food that would make people throw up. The Buffalonians hated his food SO much,
            that he expanded into the locations you see today. Eventually, He did pass, but he died with a smile on his face knowing that familes around the world would despise his
            cooking for centuries to come.
